# statistics.tex-manuscripts

This repository contains data gathered from analyzing ~90000 STM manuscripts in 2010-2016 accepted by various publishers.

In order to obtain FLS files, manuscripts were recompiled using TeX Live 2010, 2014 or 2016. <a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> The data more thoroughly is described in the article submitted to [TUG@BachoTeX 2017 conference](http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2017-en).

<a id="note1" href="#note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> Because of the used compilation configuration, one cannot make an assumption that manuscript compiled using TeX Live 2016, given some third party style files, couldn't be compiled with TeX Live 2010 also.
